Citizens Science for South African Waters

This is a project to implement crown hydrology in South Africa. Kevin Rose, a proffessor at RPI, reached out to the RCOS group at the school for help with this project. Using Twilio and MongoDB, this project will allow citizens in South Africa to text in data/images of gauge plates at rivers to help verify and maintain the quality and amount of the water, as well as the functionality of pressure plates in the rivers for the South African Department of Sanitation.
